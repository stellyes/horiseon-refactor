# Horiseon Homepage Refactor

## Description

The landing page for the Horiseon website needs refactoring to improve readability within the codebase, as well as provide more accessibility by adding and modifying semantic elements. The objective of this repository is to accomplish the following user story:

As a user, I want to be able to access the homepage and be able to properly navigate and interact with the page's accessibility features if necessary. I want the document to have a logical flow of elements and provide clear and descriptive metadata such that any impaired users will have an experience continuous with non-impaired users.

There are a number of accessibility complaince resources to refer to online. The two that I chose to use to evaluate the webpage were:

- The ADA.gov website.
- A free webpage audit from accessibilitychecker.org.
